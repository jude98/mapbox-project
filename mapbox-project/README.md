## ABOUT

This an application to build a 3D cuboidal model from a texture, which is a static location image of the location selected by the user. 
This projects uses MapBox to render live Map and extract the static image (PNG) and uses Babylon.js for making the 3D model from the texture.

### LIBRARIES USED

* react-mapbox-gl - for implementing mapbox
* react-babylonjs - babylon.Js react library

### How the App Works

When loaded, a global map will be displayed in the viewport. The map will be having the geolocation selector to select the current location of the user. 
We can select the location to be mapped to the model by double clicking on any location on the map or by moving the map pointer icon (location icon) to the desired location. Then based on latitude and longitude and the zoom value, the app ouputs a static image, placed on a container where we have options to make 3D model and back to map. On click on the map to 3D model button, the image as the texture will be provided to the scene and the 3D model will be generated.


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
